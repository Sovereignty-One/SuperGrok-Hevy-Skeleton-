                         Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works.  The licenses for
most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to make
sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the
authors of this program, use this license for our own
software to remind you of your rights.  For the same
reason, we ask you to respect this license so that everyone
else can also share in these freedoms.

The licenses for most software are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change the works.  Instead, the
GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your
freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to
make sure it remains free software for all its users.
