        🟡 MEDIUM-RISK (Secondary Priority)
        ───────────────────────────
        Numbering & Structure
        → Inconsistent definitions → Legal ambiguity

        Reporting & Traceability
	•	        → NIST vs IEEE conflicts unresolved → Non-uniform compliance
	•	
	•	        Certification Table & Remediation
	•	        → Appendix 1 unclear → Confusion on scoring & revocation
	•	
	•	        Quarterly & Closure Reports

### Treaty-Grade Enforceable Instrument

**Effective Date:** [To be determined upon ratification]  
**Registry:** United Nations Treaty Collection  
**Status:** Final Consolidated Text with Enforcement Mechanisms

-----

## PREAMBLE

The States Parties to this Convention,

RECOGNIZING the transformative potential and systemic risks of artificial intelligence systems,

AFFIRMING the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,

ACKNOWLEDGING the urgent need for international cooperation, harmonized standards, and enforceable oversight mechanisms,

DETERMINED to establish a comprehensive framework ensuring AI systems operate transparently, accountably, and in alignment with human rights and international law,

HAVE AGREED as follows:

-----

## PART I – DEFINITIONS AND SCOPE

### Article 1 – Definitions

For the purposes of this Convention:

1. **“AI System”** means any machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers from inputs how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.
1. **“High-Risk AI System”** means an AI system identified as presenting significant potential for harm to health, safety, fundamental rights, the environment, democracy, or the rule of law, as defined in Appendix 2.
1. **“Q-RAC Ledger”** (Quantum-Resistant Audit Chain) means a cryptographically secured, immutable, append-only log of AI system operations, decisions, and incidents, implementing post-quantum cryptographic standards.
1. **“Certification Authority”** means a body accredited under this Convention to assess and certify AI systems for compliance with international standards.
1. **“Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA)”** means the framework for cross-border cooperation in AI system oversight, inspection, and enforcement.
1. **“Incident”** means any AI system malfunction, security breach, rights violation, bias manifestation, or unexpected behavior meeting threshold criteria defined in Volume III.
1. **“Audit Failure”** means:
- Failure to produce required Q-RAC logs
- Discovery of tampered or incomplete records
- Obstruction of MLA inspections
- Material misrepresentation in certification submissions
1. **“Systemic Risk Event”** means:
- AI-caused harm affecting ≥1,000 individuals
- Cross-border cascading failures
- Critical infrastructure compromise
- Violation of fundamental rights at scale
- Deployment of uncertified AI in high-risk domains

-----

## PART II – CORE OBLIGATIONS

- Retention periods of minimum 7 years
1. Logs SHALL capture:
- Input-output pairs
- Decision pathways
- Confidence scores
- Human-override events
- Training data provenance
- Model version metadata
1. **Binding Requirement:** Quarterly reports SHALL automatically update certification scores via Volume IV metrics. Failure to submit reports triggers automatic status downgrade.

### Article 3 – Post-Quantum Cryptographic Standards
