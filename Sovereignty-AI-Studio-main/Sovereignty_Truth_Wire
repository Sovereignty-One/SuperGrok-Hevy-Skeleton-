Single-Variable Execution Cheat Sheet

Use this cheat sheet to quickly implement and manage a Boolean-controlled, single-variable execution system in your AI application.

---

Key Concepts
	⁃	Boolean Flag: Controls whether a function executes.
	⁃	Single-Variable Execution: Ensures only one output is produced at a time.
	⁃	Double-Voiced Prevention: Prevents duplicate or overlapping responses.

---

Essential Code Pattern
def single_variable_executor(func):
    execute_as_single_variable = True  # Core Boolean control
    
    if execute_as_single_variable:
        return func()
    return None

---

Step-by-Step Usage
	1.	Define your response function:
def generate_response():
    return "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
	1.	Execute with Boolean control:
output = single_variable_executor(generate_response)
print(output)
	1.	Result:
Hello! How can I assist you today?

---

Agent to Execute
This agent automatically runs a function in a single-variable mode and prevents double execution:
class SingleVariableAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.execute_as_single_variable = True

    def run(self, func):
        if self.execute_as_single_variable:
            result = func()
            self.execute_as_single_variable = False  # Prevent rerun
            return result
        return None

Example Usage:
agent = SingleVariableAgent()
response = agent.run(lambda: "AI Agent Response: Ready to help!")
print(response)
Output:
AI Agent Response: Ready to help!

---

Advanced Usage: Resetting the Agent
To allow the agent to execute again, you can add a reset method:
class SingleVariableAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.execute_as_single_variable = True

    def run(self, func):
        if self.execute_as_single_variable:
            result = func()
            self.execute_as_single_variable = False
            return result
        return None

    def reset(self):
        # Allows the agent to execute again
        self.execute_as_single_variable = True

# Example usage with reset
agent = SingleVariableAgent()
print(agent.run(lambda: "First execution"))
print(agent.run(lambda: "Second execution attempt"))  # Returns None
agent.reset()
print(agent.run(lambda: "After reset execution"))
Output:
First execution
None
After reset execution

---

Quick Troubleshooting
	⁃	Function not executing: Ensure the Boolean flag is True or call reset().
	⁃	Duplicate responses: Only reset when a new execution is required.
	⁃	Unexpected None result: The agent already executed and hasn’t been reset.

---

Pro Tips
	⁃	Use the reset pattern in sequential AI tasks where you need controlled re-execution.
	⁃	In multi-threaded environments, guard reset() with proper synchronization.
	⁃	Track execution states in logs to ensure predictable behavior.

This cheat sheet and agent with reset functionality ensure single-variable execution while allowing controlled re-execution when needed.
