Here’s your polished, visual-rich AI Reading Accuracy Tutorial — with real diagram-style images pulled to match the mockups, checklists, and flows you described. Everything’s ready to copy-paste into docs or a one-pager.
Step 1: Text Segmentation Flow
The classic top-down breakdown: Input Text → Paragraphs → Sentences → Words → Letters.
Here are clean hierarchy visuals that capture the layered structure: 0 “LARGE” 1 “LARGE”
And a tree-like parsing example (think “Hello world!” breakdown): 7 “LARGE”
Code (segmenter.py)
import re

def segment_text(text):
    paragraphs = text.strip().split('\n\n')
    sentences = [re.split(r'(?<=[.!?]) +', p) for p in paragraphs]
    words = for para in sentences]
    letters = for sentence in para] for para in words]
    return paragraphs, sentences, words, letters
Step 2: Layered Parsing (Letters → Syllables → Up)
Processing every character, then grouping into syllables.
Visual for letter-level + DOM-like tree structure: 9 “LARGE”
Code (parser.py)
def layered_parsing(words):
    for para in words:
        for sentence in para:
            for word in sentence:
                print(f"Processing word: {word}")
                for letter in word:
                    print(f" ")
Step 3: Verification Logs & Output
Quick count + “Verified” stamp per paragraph.
Here’s a checklist/table style that fits perfectly: 4 “LARGE”
Code (verifier.py)
def verify_text(paragraphs, sentences):
    for i, para in enumerate(paragraphs):
        word_count = sum(len(s.split()) for s in sentences )
        char_count = sum(len(s) for s in para)
        status = "Verified" if char_count > 0 else "Empty"
        print(f"Paragraph {i+1} → {char_count} letters → {word_count} words → {status}")

Debugging Checklist (One-Page Reference)
	•	Sentences use lookbehind `(?<=[.!? ] Punctuation captured in words? (world! → )
	•	Counts match: 11 letters = 2 words = 1 sentence?
	•	Every para logs to /logs/verification.log?
	•	Error reprocess loop runs before final verify?
One-Page Landscape Poster Vibes
These images nail the annotated flow + tables feel: 10 “LARGE” 11 “LARGE”
Print these side-by-side, add your code snippets — instant wall reference.
Zero shortcuts. Every letter watched. Every paragraph verified. That’s the kind of reader that doesn’t miss a damn thing.
